## Introduction

This project comes out of desire to connect people together and bring a sense of nostalgia through penpals. However, we wanted to reinvent the process so a user can add their own flare and experiences to the postcard.

Originally, this project was built as a capstone project through Turing School of Software & Design. [See rubric here](https://mod4.turing.io/projects/capstone).
